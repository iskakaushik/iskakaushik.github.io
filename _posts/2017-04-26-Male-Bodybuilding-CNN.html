  <p>It is quite common to see bodybuilding models. But how often does one come
  across a bodybuilding deep learning model? This is an attempt to build just
  that. A classifier that can detect if an image is of a "shirtless" male
  bodybuilder.</p>

  <p>Getting lot of training data is hard.
  <a href="https://keras.io">Keras</a><dt-cite key="kerasFw"></dt-cite>
  recognized that and even has a tutorial<dt-cite key="kerasImgClass"></dt-cite>
  that walks you through how you can be clever about training a relatively awesome
  model with just a few hundred images. For the images themselves I used

  <h2>Note</h2>
    <p>
    1.      Since we will be working with a limited set of images, we should try and
            make our model as simple as possible. The way I think of it -- if a model is
            complex, if acquires a lot of information about your training set, and can be
            prone to overfitting.
    </p>
    <p>
    2.      Keras tutorial talks about ways to modulate the entropy or the amount of
            memory the model has about our training data. Some of these are L1/L2
            regularization, or Dropout (where we do not allow a layer to see too many images
            of the same kind?). I have not studied them yet, but I get a sense for the high
            level idea though.
