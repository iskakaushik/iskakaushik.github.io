# How to Break Apps

Starting March 20th 2017, I started a rotation (3 month team switch) to the Application Security Team at [Palantir](https://www.palantir.com/). I wish to capture my learnings, primarily for my reference. Hopefully, this will be useful for someone someday. Most of these learning would not have been possible without the team.

## I plan on writing about the following:

1. Using CSP to prevent XSS effectively. Also potential close calls (img src blob attack if using angular, or any other JSONP).
2. Using Content-Disposition for XSS.
3. Why online IDEs need to watch out for Annotation Processing support.
4. Exporting Spreadsheets and Excel Macros
