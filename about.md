Hi, I'm Kaushik Iska. Here are a few things about me.

* I work as a Software Engineer at [Google](https://google.com). I work on [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) and [Fuchsia](https://fuchsia.dev).
* I was fortunate enough to be advised by [Dr. Kishore Kothapalli](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/kkishore/) during my Bachelors in Computer Science ([Honors in Computational Geometry](https://oldwww.iiit.ac.in/academics/curriculum/ug_honors)) from IIIT Hyderabad.
* Some of my prior posts are over at [Medium](https://medium.com/iskakaushik), but I've moved from there.
* I enjoy reading various genres. If you like, you can follow me on [goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/iskakaushik), or <a href="mailto:iska.kaushik@gmail.com?subject=Book Recommendation for Kaushik">recommend a book to me</a>.
